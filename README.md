# 🎥 Movie Recommendation System  

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Movie Recommendation System** developed during my internship at **YBI Foundation**. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences and behavior. It was implemented on **Google Colab** using **Python** and popular machine learning libraries.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests movies tailored to user preferences.  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user and item similarities for recommendation.  
- **Efficient Computation**: Optimized for performance with scalable machine learning algorithms.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for user interaction (if applicable).  

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools  
- **Platform**: Google Colab  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis  
  - NumPy: Numerical computing  
  - Scikit-learn: Building and evaluating the recommendation model  
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn: (If used) Data visualization  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Dataset**: Used a publicly available movie dataset containing user ratings and movie details.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for training the model.  
3. **Model**: Implemented a collaborative filtering algorithm to predict user preferences.  
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like RMSE or precision-recall.
